# Reverse-engineering
In the workplace we are going to be prompted with a series of code that we must explain our thought processes through. We are given script files that we must go through line by line and comment out our thought processes of how that function interacts with the entireity of the program. 
## Getting started
This file contains a packages.json file that by running "npm  install" in the command line, will run the program well. 
* We are given a develop directory containing all scripts. These scripts contain minimal comments already, but are missing essential definitions that an employer might include during screening.
